# **Development and production Enviroments**

**TWC** system is configured into two environments with different base URLs but identical API endpoints for ease of usage for the developers and insulating the customers for the security and stability of the system.

Development and Production client credentials will not be identical. The tenantId tenantId can be configured as the same for both, but it is recommended to differentiate them across environments.

These credentials will only work in their environment and are not interchangeable with different environments.

TWC recommends to follow a three-step development process to achieve the same. The feature or service being developed is developed to a beta version locally and hosted on the Developing/Staging environment once local testing is done.

Further testing and validations are done on the staging environment of the service/feature and its integration to other services and lambdas. Once all bugs are cleared if present, then the product is moved to the Production environment where the customers can use it for their real-world applications 

## **Developing Enviroment**
 
To generate Auth token , one has to use the authenticattion url to send the client id and secret of the tenant in the Deelopment/Staging enviroment. 
For further details, visit [Authentication Service](authenticationsvcApi.md) page.

Auth token generation is a mandatory for using any APIs in the TWC stsyem. Faliure to do so will reult in **401 Unauthorized** error.
